## Importing libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)  
library(cowplot)
```

## Importing data

```{r}

biopsy <- read_csv("https://wilkelab.org/classes/SDS348/data_sets/biopsy.csv")
```

## Three things we have to do

In general, when performing PCA, weâ€™ll want to do (at least) three things:

## Look at the data in PC coordinates.

```{r}
pca_fit <- biopsy %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% # retain only numeric columns
  prcomp(scale = TRUE) # do PCA on scaled data
```

## Look at the rotation matrix.

```{r}
arrow_style <- arrow(
  angle = 20, ends = "first", type = "closed", length = grid::unit(8, "pt")
)

# plot rotation matrix
pca_fit %>%
  tidy(matrix = "rotation") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "PC", names_prefix = "PC", values_from = "value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_segment(xend = 0, yend = 0, arrow = arrow_style) +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = column),
    hjust = 1, nudge_x = -0.04
  ) +
  xlim(-1.25, .5) + ylim(-.5, 1) 
```

This plot shows the loadings of the features for PC1 and PC2. The longer the arrow is, the stronger the feature determined the direction of the PC(if the loadings would be squared it would represent the contribution to the variance of this PC). PC2 apperantley represent the changes correlated to mitosis of the breast cancer biopsies. \[Abdi and Willimas, 2010\]
